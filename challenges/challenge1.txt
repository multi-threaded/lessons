Coding Challenge: Fruit Selector

Objective: Create a simple program that allows a user to select a fruit from a predefined
           list and check if it is available. If the fruit is available, print a message
           indicating that the fruit is available; otherwise, print a message indicating
           that it is not available.

Instructions:
    1. Create a list of fruits that includes at least five different fruits (e.g., "apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "grape").
    2. Ask the user to input the name of a fruit they want to check.
    3. Use an if-else statement to check if the fruit is in the list:
        - If the fruit is in the list, print a message saying that the fruit is available.
        - If the fruit is not in the list, print a message saying that the fruit is not available.
    4. Use a for loop to print each fruit in the list, prefixed with "Available fruit: ".
